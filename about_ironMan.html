  <p>Iron man is not made of iron, he is a human.</p>
  </br>
  <h3>Reason why I like Iron Man</h3>
  <p>Because he's a boss</p>
  </br>
  <h3>Who is he? </h3>
  <p>Firstly, if you don't know who Iron Man is, you have been living under a rock. Secondly, Iron Man is really a billionaire named Tony Stark. <s> this is why his ego is <b> HUGE </b> and he acts like a butthead all the time</s> Tony first became Iron Man in Afghanistan, where he used scrap metal to make a metal suit to break out of captivity. Tony has since created many reincarnations of the Iron Man suit, most recently the Mk V, which can deploy from a rocket.</p>
